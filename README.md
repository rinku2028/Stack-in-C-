Stack in C#

Stack is a collection which represents Last in First Out(LIFO) conept. For better understaning, an example of stack of books kept on top of each other. 

The concept of lasâ€™t in first out in the case of books means that only the top most book can be removed from the stack of books. It is not possible to remove a book from between, because then that would disturb the setting of the stack.

So we will implement this LIFO concept in programming with examples.
